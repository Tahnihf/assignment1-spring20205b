    <h1>What is Mingle?</h1>
    <p><em>Mingle</em> provides young adults (aged 18-34) living in or travelling to Sydney
        with a networking service to help them <b>discover new activities/venues around Sydney
        and meet new people with common interests</b>. The app uses an Artificial Intelligence
        Algorithm to bring like-minded people together and suggest activities through analysing
        common interests, location and budget preferences.

    <h1>How does Mingle work?</h1>
    <p>The initial user registration process requires the user to select locations of
        where they want to mingle and their interests. Mingle allows the user to swipe right <em>(to
        mingle)</em> or swipe left <em>(not mingle)</em> on each user’s profile that appears. Once the user
        swipes right, the interests of both individuals are scanned and matches these common
        interests with 4 suggested activities and their cost for the users to attend together. Both
        users are then to select which suggestion/s they would be happy to attend and select
        which dates they are free in the private calendar. Both users can see the suggestions,
        calendar and their selections. They can then start chatting, knowing what suggestions
        are of favour to the other person and what dates they are both free<mark>...making the planning
        process a whole lot easier! </mark>
